## NOTE: there is no READme or javascript file for this prompt. Just answer each question below in your own words and be as thorough as possible.

1. When would you use a for loop and when would you use a for-in loop?
You would use for loops to loop through the same code several times. You would use a for in loop to loop through the properties or key(s) of an object or an array which is actually an object. 

2. What is an anonymous function? Why would we want to use one?
An anonymous function is an unnamed function. We would use it if we only want to use a local scoped function which can only be accessed within another function. 
3. What is an IIFE, and how is it written?

4. Why do we write tests for our code? We write tests for code to make sure that it runs and to reduce bugs before rolling out a product. 

5. What does it mean to clone a repo? Cloning a repo simply means that you are "copying" it to your repository. In our case during programming, the repository is represented by the engineering database called Github.

6. What is a higher order function? What is a callback?
7. A higher order function is a function that can take another function as an argument.
